Limitations:

1. We are not looking at how much distance the vehicle has already covered in an edge square when allocating data. Even if the vehicle may only be in the coverage region for a few sec compared to the total time period of the time slot, we still assume it is there for the entire time period and thus allocate data acordingly.
